The following links may help in adding slope (gradient), aspect, and water layers to the cow tracker app:

computing distance to point...they even use a water example after the road example

I think you do something like this.
library(rgdal)
streams.v <- readOGR("data", "streams")

library(maptools) 
then you can use their distance() function
